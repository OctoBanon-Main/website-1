        <a class="text">
            I'm a 16 years old high school student who love open-source, Linux and related stuff, developing software and learning computer science.
            I develop programs in C#, Python and Rust.
            Usually, I prefer to use C# because I love .NET for they feature-rich standard library.
            I have learned C# in early 2019, and now I can code in Python and Rust.
            All in all, I like to create cool things that can be useful to someone! <br> <br>

            I use ArchLinux as my main OS, because Windows is too bloated and my machine runs slower on it.
            Also, I have compiled <u>linux-cachyos-bore</u> kernel for better performance and stability.
            As Desktop Environment I prefer to use Hyprland Wayland Compositor.
            Fish - my favorite shell. I love them for their user-friendly usage and functionality.

        <a class="h1">Toolkit</a>
        <a class="text">
            For Python and Rust I use Neovim with configured plugins for better linting and diagnostics.
            Neovim is my favorite text and code editor.
            It is fully compatible with Vim plugins and has Lua support for better configuration.
            What about tools, not editors?
            Pretty standard, <u>dotnet</u> for C# and .NET development, default python interpreter for Python development.
            That's all about my toolkit.
